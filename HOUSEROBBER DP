1)ou are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.


INTUITION , ETC ETC

ANS)SO IF THE ROBBER WENT TO TQWO ADJACENT OR ADJACENT HOUSES , THE ALARM MIGHT RING , SO THE ROBBER 1ST WENT TO 1 THEN MISSED 2 AND WNET TO 3 INASTEAD

1) HOW IS MEMOIZATION WORKING HERE , LIKE THE ROBBER IS GOING TO THE EACH HOUSES , I THINK ITS A DP PROBLEM AND GREEDY APPROACH MIGHT NOT WORK , I AM ALSO HINKING ABT THE ODDD EVENE APPROACH OF THE PROBLEM .
