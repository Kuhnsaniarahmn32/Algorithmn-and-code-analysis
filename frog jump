LETS STUDY THE DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF FROG JUMP, BECAUSE SOFTWAREENGINEERING HASNT CRUSHED US ENOUGH
  1ST PROBLEM :
A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. The frog can only jump in the forward direction.

 

Example 1:

Input: stones = [0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]
Output: true
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.

Hint
You are given a 0-indexed integer array stones sorted in strictly increasing order representing the positions of stones in a river.

A frog, initially on the first stone, wants to travel to the last stone and then return to the first stone. However, it can jump to any stone at most once.

The length of a jump is the absolute difference between the position of the stone the frog is currently on and the position of the stone to which the frog jumps.

More formally, if the frog is at stones[i] and is jumping to stones[j], the length of the jump is |stones[i] - stones[j]|.
The cost of a path is the maximum length of a jump among all jumps in the path.

Return the minimum cost of a path for the frog.
